      <p>Capybaras are talented swimmers.  Their webbed toes and long fur make them perfectly adapted to life in the water.  <br> <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/cabybara-facts" target="_blank"> Source: National Geographic</a> <br> <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/zoo-capybara-animal-mammalian-my-4085027/" target="_blank"> Image source: Pixabay</a></p>

      <p>Capybaras are herbivores.  They enjoy a diet of grass and aquatic plants.  Interestingly, capybaras consume their own feces as a means of collecting bacteria to aid digestion of the tough vegetal fibers.  <br> <a href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/species/capybara/#:~:text=They%20are%20herbivores%20and%20eat,the%20fiber%20from%20the%20grass." target="_blank"> Source: Rainforest Alliance</a> <br> <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/jlzC3pHujHs" target="_blank"> Image source: Unsplash</a></p>

      <p>Although the capybara appears cute and cuddly, these animals grow to an astounding size.  In length, they range from 39-51 inches (3-4 feet). The rodent can weigh as much as 200 pounds. <br> <a href="https://www.livescience.com/55223-capybara-facts.html" target="_blank"> Source: Livescience</a> <br> <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/2EmW_HIy6Ns" target="_blank"> Image source: Unsplash</a></p>
