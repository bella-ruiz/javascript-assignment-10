      <p>Capybaras are herbivores.  They enjoy a diet of grass and aquatic plants.  Interestingly, capybaras consume their own feces as a means of collecting bacteria to aid digestion of the tough vegetal fibers.  <br> <a href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/species/capybara/#:~:text=They%20are%20herbivores%20and%20eat,the%20fiber%20from%20the%20grass." target="_blank"> Source: Rainforest Alliance</a> <br> <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/jlzC3pHujHs" target="_blank"> Image source: Unsplash</a></p>
